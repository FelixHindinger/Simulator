# Simulator

This repository contains a modified implementation of the mix network simulator proposed by Piotrowska (https://github.com/aniampio/Simulator).

The implementation is done using Python 3. 
Before running the code remember to make sure that you have all the dependencies installed.

To install the dependencies run

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

To run the simulator you need the command

`python3 playground.py`

You can change the parameters of the simulation in file `test_config.json`

The functionality of this simulator has only been tested for the stratified topology used in my thesis.
